These are my packages for Arch Linux and/or Arch Linux ARM.

Most of them are available through the AUR:
http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?SeB=m&L=2&K=fleger

Prebuilt DreamPlug related packages are also available for Arch Linux ARM.
Just add the following lines to your /etc/pacman.conf:

    [dreamplug]
    Server = http://farcaster.zapto.org/alarm/dreamplug/$arch
